### With spring creeping around the corner, people are excited to get out and do fun things! What else sounds better than having a beer on a sunny day? Our group was able to put our minds together and create a platform to help users search for breweries by "city" entered. The current weather conditions will also be displayed for the search location to help guide users if the weather conditions are favorable to go sit at a patio for a pint, or if they feel like checking out a micro brewery instead!

### The API we used to get data for breweries searched provides the following selected information: 
    *Brewery Type : i.e. Mirco, Brewpub, Nano
    *Street Address
    *Website URL

### The API we used to get data for current weather conditions for the searched location provides the following selected information: 
    *Temperature
    *Wind Speed
    *Humidity
    *UV Index
    *Sunset Time

### With the information our data provides will assist in helping users select an appropiate location to enjoy a brew!

### Another feature our platform has with API data is having an option to search by location to filter and organize breweries by distance from the city selected (i.e. closest to farthest.) 

### The local storage component our group has intergrated into our platform and design is to provide a "Favorites" checkbox for users to save their favorite breweries! In saving these selections, users can access the stored data to go back and look at some enjoyable places they have been to. This checkbox function is a great way to keep track of places visited, and what is still on the list to explore!
